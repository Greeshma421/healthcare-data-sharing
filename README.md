A full-stack solution for secure and efficient healthcare data sharing, integrating OCR-based prescription processing, role-based access control, and a real-time analytics dashboard. This system enables doctors, pharmacists, and healthcare admins to collaborate over medical data with precision and privacy.

üîç Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning, computer vision, and cloud-native tools to build a hierarchical data sharing system.
